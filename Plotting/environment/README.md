Welcome to Tobias Abelmann and Marek Michulka's (alphabetical) attempt to process and plot ACDC data outputs

We have created some very basic functions that allow you to plot ACDC outputs in 2 ways currently: 
1. Plotting a single event of a single channel
2. Plotting a single event from all channels of one PSEC4 chip

To do this, at the bottom of Main.py, you need to do a few things:
1. Copy and paste the path to the desired data file in line 106
2. Uncomment the desired command (either plotOneChannel or plotOnePSEC) and input the desired event and channel/PSEC4 number.
