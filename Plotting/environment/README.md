Welcome to Tobias Abelmann and Marek Michulka's (alphabetical) attempt to process and plot ACDC data outputs

We have created some very basic functions that allow you to plot ACDC outputs in 2 ways currently: 
1. Plotting a single event of a single channel
2. Plotting a single event from all channels of one PSEC4 chip
3. PLotting a single event from one channel of each PSEC4 chip.

To do this, at the bottom of Main.py, you need to do a few things:
1. Copy and paste the path to the desired data file in line 139
2. Copy and paste the path to the desired calibration data in line 140
3. Uncomment the desired command (either plotOneChannel, plotOnePSEC, makeChart) and input the desired event and channel/PSEC4 number.

The ACDC will give the data file in the Results folder and the calibrations in Autogenerated_Calibrations.

Currently, each of the functions are designed to save the graph as a .png file. If this is not desired, comment out the "plt.savefig" lines.

This would be better with classes. We know. We are sorry.
