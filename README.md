Here will be a new readme soon!

## Prerequisites
This code is built using `cmake` and requires `libusb` headers (which usually come prepackaged with your os-- you may want to double-check).

To install on a debian-based machine

```bash
$ sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake
```

gcc/g++ version optimally is >7.1 
cmake version is >3.1
